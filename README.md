****Ecovision: Segregate Today, Sustain Tomorrow****
**ðŸ’¡ Project Summary**
Ecovision is an AI/IoT-powered platform designed to revolutionize waste segregation and public sanitation across India. Developed in alignment with the national goals of Atmanirbhar Bharat and the Swadeshi movement, this project directly addresses Problem Statement ID: 25128 (Clean & Green Technology).

**Mission Statement**
AI/IoT-powered platform to drive waste segregation and improved public sanitation across India, aligning with the Swadeshi and Atmanirbhar Bharat missions. The solution uses image recognition to categorize waste and digital tracking to optimize collection and recycling efforts for a cleaner, greener future.

**âœ¨ Core Solution Components**
The platform operates across the waste management value chain, utilizing smart technology to ensure efficiency and transparency:

_AI Segregation Engine:_

Uses Machine Learning (Image Recognition) to automatically classify waste types (Biodegradable, Non-Biodegradable, Hazardous) from citizen-submitted photos or smart camera feeds.

Provides instant, verifiable feedback to users on correct segregation.

_Citizen Engagement & Reporting:_

A simple web application for citizens to report unsegregated waste dumping or sanitation issues with geotagging for immediate municipal action.

Drives compliance through a gamified user experience.

_Smart Logistics & Tracking:_

Simulates integration with IoT sensors in public bins to alert the system when they are full or require maintenance.

Uses Route Optimization algorithms on a central dashboard to streamline municipal vehicle collection paths, reducing operational costs and carbon footprint.

**ðŸ›  Technology Highlights**
The prototype is built using foundational web technologies to demonstrate core functionality:

_Frontend_: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive user interface.

_Core Logic_: Conceptual integration of Python/TensorFlow/Keras for the AI classification model.

_Infrastructure_: Designed for easy deployment and scaling on cloud services to handle data from multiple cities.

**ðŸ‘¥ Team & Alignment**
This project is submitted by SolvX and guided by the principles of providing local, sustainable, and smart solutions (Swadeshi) for a self-reliant India (Atmanirbhar Bharat).

_Goal_: To deliver a scalable, transparent, and effective solution for the Swachh Bharat Mission.
